Payments Use Cases
==================

This repository is setup to document use cases for payments on web on mobile. On March 24-25 the W3C will hold a [Workshop on Web Payments](http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/Overview.html). We have been asked to submit our use cases to help define the work the W3C will do on web payments in the future. 

Drop your use cases onto the wiki page [here](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/payments-use-cases/wiki/Use-Case-List). Everyone should have access to this page.

When we have collected enough use cases, we will write them up here for the workshop.
