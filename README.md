Use Cases and Requirements for Web Payments
==================

This document outlines the use cases and requirements we payments on mobile. The use cases and requirements were gathered by gathering data on web and native applications with payment functionality, as well as looking at native payment platforms. 


## Motiviation

On March 24-25 the W3C will hold a [Workshop on Web Payments](http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/Overview.html). We have been asked to submit our use cases to help define the work the W3C will do on web payments in the future.
